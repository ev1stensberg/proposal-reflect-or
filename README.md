## Reflect.logicalOR ( _object_, _object_, _[value]_ )

When the `logicalOR` method is called with arguments, the following steps are taken:
  1. Let Reflect be an **object**.
  1. Let _object_ be ? an **object**.
  1. Let _object_ be ? an **object**.
  1. Let _[value]_ be ? an **primitive** that returns null or undefined based on what the user inputs.
  1. Calculations happens through normal OR logic rules.
  1. Return a the new value upon the "Reflected" object, of which, the user assigns.
